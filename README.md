# Model Overview

## Description:

Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct is a large language model customized by NVIDIA to improve the helpfulness of LLM generated responses to user queries.


This model reaches [Arena Hard](https://github.com/lmarena/arena-hard-auto) of 85.0, [AlpacaEval 2 LC](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/) of 57.6 and [GPT-4-Turbo MT-Bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/pull/3158) of 8.98, which are known to be predictive of [LMSys Chatbot Arena Elo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard)

As of 1 Oct 2024, this model is #1 on all three automatic alignment benchmarks (verified tab for AlpacaEval 2 LC), edging out strong frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

This model was trained using RLHF (specifically, REINFORCE), [Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward) and [HelpSteer2-Preference prompts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2) on a Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model as the initial policy.

Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-HF has been converted from [Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct) to support it in the HuggingFace Transformers codebase. Please note that evaluation results might be slightly different from the [Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct) as evaluated in NeMo-Aligner, which the evaluation results below are based on.

Try hosted inference for free at [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_1-nemotron-70b-instruct) - it comes with an OpenAI-compatible API interface.


See details on our paper at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01257](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01257) - as a preview, this model can correctly the question ```How many r in strawberry?``` without specialized prompting or additional reasoning tokens:

```
A sweet question!
Let’s count the “R”s in “strawberry”:
1. S
2. T
3. R
4. A
5. W
6. B
7. E
8. R
9. R
10. Y
There are **3 “R”s** in the word “strawberry”.
```

Note: This model is a demonstration of our techniques for improving helpfulness in general-domain instruction following. It has not been tuned for performance in specialized domains such as math.

## Evaluation Metrics

As of 1 Oct 2024, Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct performs best on Arena Hard, AlpacaEval 2 LC (verified tab) and MT Bench (GPT-4-Turbo)

 | Model  | Arena Hard | AlpacaEval | MT-Bench | Mean Response Length |
|:-----------------------------|:----------------|:-----|:----------|:-------|
|Details | (95% CI) | 2 LC (SE) | (GPT-4-Turbo) | (# of Characters for MT-Bench)| 
| _**Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct**_ | **85.0** (-1.5, 1.5) | **57.6** (1.65) | **8.98** | 2199.8 | 
| Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct | 55.7 (-2.9, 2.7) | 38.1 (0.90)  | 8.22 | 1728.6 |
| Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct | 69.3 (-2.4, 2.2) | 39.3 (1.43) | 8.49 | 1664.7 |
| Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20240620 | 79.2 (-1.9, 1.7) | 52.4 (1.47) | 8.81 | 1619.9 |
| GPT-4o-2024-05-13 | 79.3 (-2.1, 2.0) | 57.5 (1.47) | 8.74 | 1752.2 |
         
## Usage:

You can use the model using HuggingFace Transformers library with 2 or more 80GB GPUs (NVIDIA Ampere or newer) with at least 150GB of free disk space to accomodate the download.

This code has been tested on Transformers v4.44.0, torch v2.4.0 and 2 A100 80GB GPUs, but any setup that supports ```meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct``` should support this model as well. If you run into problems, you can consider doing ```pip install -U transformers```.


```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model_name = "nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-HF"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = "How many r in strawberry?"
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

tokenized_message = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt", return_dict=True)
response_token_ids = model.generate(tokenized_message['input_ids'].cuda(),attention_mask=tokenized_message['attention_mask'].cuda(),  max_new_tokens=4096, pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id)
generated_tokens =response_token_ids[:, len(tokenized_message['input_ids'][0]):]
generated_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(generated_text)
